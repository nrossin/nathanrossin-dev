## 💡 Development Notes

This site was built as both a portfolio and a learning tool. All code is modularized into reusable components with an
emphasis on clarity and maintainability.

I wrote all code manually, even when seeking support from AI (like ChatGPT). My goal wasn't just to "get it working" —
but to understand how each part functions and fits together.
