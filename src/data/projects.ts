        # Overview

        _An expansive suite of applications designed to replace multiple Excel spreadsheets, documentation, etc._

        # Background
        
        Rep Assist was originally bourne out of a desire to stop repeatedly typing the same comments over and over again
        when customers would call in to service their insurance policies ("add driver," "make payment," etc.). The first
        version of this app was simply known as "Comment Master" and helped to automatically generate standardized
        comments to be copy/pasted into our CMS system.
        
        After changing departments, the scope grew quite rapidly. Our new department was dependent on multiple Excel
        spreadsheets and other loose documents; there was no central location for the department's knowledge. After
        spending time working the phones in that department, I began adapting and expanding rep assist to meet the unique
        needs of that team.
        
        Over the next few years, rep assist became a de-facto customer relationship manager and knowledge management suite
        of applications.

        # Challenges & Solutions
        
        **Challenge:** At the beginning, I did not know how to create applications at all.  
        **Solution:** After researching languages (in 2015), I decided to learn Java and JavaFX, using this particular project as my learning goal.
        
        **Challenge:** As the user base grew, the application became less stable  
        **Solution:** Moved "backend" from a shared network drive to SQL Server database

        # Overview

        _A visual database and reporting tool intended to assist the insurance agency with managing the status of 
        policy filings with each state._
        
        ---
        
        # Background
        
        For many years, our team had used manually-updated Excel spreadsheets to track the state filing statuses of thousands
        of insurance policies. With errors leading to sometimes massive penalties from state regulatory agencies, there
        was a genuine need to move to a more modern solution.
        
        The industry itself does not already have such a solution available, so I set about creating the first of its kind.
        
        The E&S Filing Manager was created as an add-on to Rep Assist that allowed our teams to accurately track, plan, and
        report on the current filing status for these policies.
        
        ---
        
        # Impact
        
        - ðŸ’² Within the first year of its operation, the agency had saved over $10,000 in state fines and penalties.
        - âŒ› No more late filings!
